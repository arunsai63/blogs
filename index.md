## About Me
Hi, I’m Sai Arun Munaganti, a Solution Architect with over 6 years of experience in full-stack development, DevOps, and blockchain. I’m currently leading the engineering team at Echor Tech. My job is to design and build scalable backend solutions using AWS, turning client ideas into real, working products. I manage everything—from planning and coding to deployment and monitoring—making sure it all runs smoothly.


I’m skilled in tools like AWS, React, Python, Node.js, Rust, Docker, and blockchain tech. I love solving tough problems, optimizing systems, and teaching others—I’ve been a volunteer Python teacher at Swecha.org since 2018. I studied Computer Science & Engineering at JNTUH College of Engineering in Hyderabad, where I was part of the FOSS Club and built a handwritten character recognition system as my major project.

## What This Blog Is About
I started this blog to share what I’ve learned from years of coding, building, and scaling tech projects. I’ll write about things I work on every day—stuff like cloud computing, web development, DevOps, and blockchain. My goal is to keep it simple and useful, whether you’re a beginner or a pro. I’ll try to post blogs frequently so there’s always something new to read.

## Types of Tech Blogs You’ll Find Here
Here’s what I plan to cover:

1. **Cloud Computing**  
   I’ll write about AWS, how to build scalable systems, and tips for cutting server costs. Expect posts like “How I Reduced Costs to $30/Month for 30,000 Users” or “Setting Up CI/CD on AWS.”

2. **Web Development**  
   Look out for blogs on React, Rust with WebAssembly (WASM), and Node.js. I’ve already posted about Rust and WASM—check it out below! I’ll share simple ways to make fast, reliable web apps.

3. **DevOps Made Easy**  
   I’ll explain tools like Docker, CI/CD pipelines, and Infrastructure as Code (IAAC). Think “How to Move from Monolith to Microservices” or “Deploying Apps with Zero Downtime.”

4. **Blockchain & Crypto**  
   With my experience launching $20M crypto projects, I’ll dive into blockchain development, smart contracts, and trading platforms. Posts might include “Building a Crypto App from Scratch” or “What I Learned Scaling to Thousands of Users.”

5. **Coding Tips & Tutorials**  
   I’ll share quick guides on Python, Rust, and more. These will be beginner-friendly, like “Python Basics for New Coders” or “Why Rust Is My Go-To Language.”

6. **Project Stories**  
   I’ll tell behind-the-scenes stories of projects I’ve built—like scaling Landwey or migrating systems to AWS. These will show what worked, what didn’t, and how I fixed it.

## Why I’m Doing This
I’ve been lucky to work on some cool projects and learn a ton along the way. This blog is my way of giving back. Whether you’re learning to code, building your own app, or just curious about tech, I hope you find something helpful here. Plus, writing helps me organize my thoughts and keep learning—so it’s a win-win!
