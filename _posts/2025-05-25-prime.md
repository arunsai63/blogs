# 🚀 From Hours to Milliseconds: A Journey Through Code Optimization

Every developer writes a brute-force solution at some point — often just to get things working.  
But what if that **quick-and-dirty function** was silently tanking your performance?

In this post, we'll explore how to go from **slow and clunky** to **blazing fast**, using one deceptively simple problem: **checking if a number is prime**.

---

## 🧩 The Problem: `is_prime(n)`

We want a function that checks if a number is prime. Easy to describe. Easy to get wrong.

Let’s start with a naive solution and work our way up.

---

## 🐌 Step 1: Naive Brute Force (Please Don’t)

```python
def is_prime(n: int):
    factors_count = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            factors_count += 1
    return factors_count == 2

🔻 What’s wrong here?
It checks every number from 1 to n.
Try this with 10,000 numbers? Pack a lunch.

⚙️ Step 3: Basic Divisibility

def is_prime(n: int):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

✅ Exits early on the first divisor — a decent start, but still O(n).

⸻

⚡ Step 4: Skip Even Numbers

def is_prime(n: int):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n == 2:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return False
    for i in range(3, n, 2):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

🧠 Insight: Half the numbers are even. Skip them.

Result: ~2× faster in practice.

🧮 Step 5: Square Root Optimization

import math

def is_prime(n: int):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n == 2:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return False
    for i in range(3, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1, 2):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

🏃‍♂️ Loop now runs √n times, not n. That’s a massive upgrade.

⸻

🧠 Step 6: The 6k ± 1 Trick

def is_prime(n: int):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True

💡 Why this works: All primes > 3 are of the form 6k ± 1.
Fewer checks = faster results.

⸻

🧪 Benchmark Results

We ran each function on 10,000 numbers (from 100,000 to 110,000):

Version	Relative Time (best = 1.0)
Step 3: Basic Loop	~2.24× slower
Step 4: Skip Even	~1.00×
Step 5: √n Optimization	~0.01× (fastest)
Step 6: 6k ± 1 Rule	~0.01× (fastest)

⚠️ Step 1 took too long to even finish.

⸻

🧠 Optimization Takeaways

This wasn’t just about prime numbers. It’s a mini-lesson in performance thinking:
	•	✅ Exit early when possible
	•	🧹 Cut unnecessary work (e.g., skip evens, stop at √n)
	•	🧠 Use mathematical structure where it exists
	•	⏱️ Always measure — not guess

⸻

🧵 Final Thoughts

You don’t need to over-optimize everything.

But knowing how and when to optimize makes you a better developer — and a faster one, too.

The humble is_prime() function is a beautiful example:
	•	Start naive
	•	Refine the logic
	•	Eliminate waste
	•	Apply theory
